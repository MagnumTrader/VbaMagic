# VbaMagic (Dark magic)

Collection of scripts to be used in excel.\
Documentation for each individual script is in the comments of each file.

These are for my own use and can therefore be specific in some cases for my convenience.

## Scripts index

## How do i use the scripts in my Excel file?
Open Visual basic in Excel -> File -> Import File...\
the script will now appear in the modules folder of the current Excel file.
